# Stock-Analysis
## Overview
Within this analysis research for a specific stock in the years, this is easier to search through in a large database. The worksheet incldes a way to run the lenght it may take to analyza the large amount od dat in addtion to the numerous stock analysis. Included is also a button to make analysis easier than using macros.
## Results
In the table that is shown in the Worksheet it seems like the year 2017 was better overall for most of the stocks with the exception of stock TERP, which was actually in the negatives. In 2018 TERP remaind the same, however the rest of the stocks also took a downturn, with the exception of ENPH and RUN, who had 81.9% Return and 84% respectively. With the length of time it took to pull up the data it seems like the year 2017 took longer. Below are included images.

When refactoring, the code that is written will usually be edited and revised so that there is less and overall functinality is increased. Within this data and the worksheet it can be said that it soes prove tht ther are more efficient ways to change the code, either by including loops or bolean loops, however something that I did also come across was the constant error messages that can also occur from changing the code that can confuse those that are still new to VBA.
